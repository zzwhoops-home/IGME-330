        <h2>I. 2 Audio Effect nodes</h2>
        <p>I added a <code>StereoPannerNode</code> and a <code>WaveShaperNode</code>, which I read online can do
            panning left and right and apply a distortion effect, respectively. Both are additional sliders, with the
            panner going between [-1, 1] and the WaveShaper having a custom <code>makeDistortionCurve(amount)</code>
            function which I found on <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/StereoPannerNode/StereoPannerNode">mdn</a>. All I
            know is that this creates an array of floats which tell the <code>WaveShaperNode</code> how to alter the
            waveform, which in this case produces a distortion effect.</p>

        <h2>II. Sprite</h2>
        <p>My <code>TeslaSprite</code> class is located within <code>src/sprite.js</code>, and I made an animation that
            should be reminiscent of a Tesla coil. While it does not arc to anything on screen, there are several things
            which are affected by the average volume. The average volume is determined by two parameters,
            <code>dataStart</code> and <code>dataEnd</code>. The <code>audioData</code> is sliced between these values,
            0 being the beginning of the data and 1 being the end, and its values are averaged. These attributes of the
            "Tesla coil" are affected:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Radius of arcs - how far the arcs travel</li>
            <li>Radius variance - how much the arc travel distance varies</li>
            <li>Number of arcs</li>
            <li>y-distance - this will act as if it is "traveling" with the rectangles behind</li>
            <li>Alpha value of lines - a smaller value will make the lines fade out more</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By default, I have placed two coils, one on each side. The left coil corresponds to the lower frequencies
            between 0 and 0.5, and the right coil corresponds to the higher frequencies between 0.5 and 1.0. However, if
            you use the "Coil Slider", you can change the data range that is averaged.</p>
